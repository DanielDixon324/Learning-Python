# Learning-Python
My project to teach myself python step by step in both python and using visual studio. If you see any errors in the code I would be happy to hear them. This is also my project to learn how uploading to Github works and the process of creating a repository.



Test 1 - Hello World. My first python test involves doing the classsic code of Hello world, it also involve the creation and calling of a function and the use of user input to give the user a name.

Test 2 - Calculator. After getting the basics down I moved on to using functions with variables passed through as well as assigning vaiables straight from user input. Having worked previously with languages that need the variable defined it's weird to not need it but I'm getting the hang of it.

Test 3 - Hangman. I took this as a coding prompt from a python coding ideas website and it was a good challenge for my skill level at the time. It used different libraries, different algorithms and just all round a lot more detailed code.

Test 4 - Dice. 

Test 5 - URLs.
